It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. In layman's terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house."

The document is then saved with the '.html' extension. Once saved, the browser interprets the HTML document, reads it, and renders the web page."
